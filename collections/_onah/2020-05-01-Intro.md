Dear Oliver,

[![Biker Boys](/assets/onah/bikers_350.jpg){: .align-right .sph_img}](/assets/onah/splash.jpeg)

I hope you are well and will take the time to read this - it's not very long.

Maybe you remember this photo? It is the last one I have of us together, taken just a few days before you last stayed with me in Mariehamn. I calculated today that was a full 666 days ago. Quite why it has been so long, I'm still not sure. Hopefully you can explain one day.

Despite everything, I don't want us to lose touch. Text messages are not a good way to maintain contact and so I thought I'd create this page - my *Oliver Blog* - to share with you what I'm up to. This way I can send more complete news of what I'm doing, maybe news from Nanan & Grandad, Uncle Chris, and other people, and you can always access it no matter where you are or what phone/computer you have.

Note that this is a public site. It has to be to make it easy for you to access - no passwords or other restrictions - just a simple web address which will always be `https://sphardy.com/onah2005`.

That said, unless you share the page, no-one else will see it except you & me. Nothing I post here should be found on Google or any other place. Nor is there any tracking (check the page code!) so even I will have no idea if you are reading any of this; it's for you to decide to read if and when you want to. I'll just hope you are and try to keep updating it. Once a month maybe? I can text you when I've added something new.

That's all for now. I'll be in touch when there's more to share. And feel free to stop by any time - [Torggatan 8A](https://w3w.co/former.uptake.swells) if you didn't know - you are always welcome.

I love you son

\- Dad -
